*******************************************************

This project is about predicting heart diseases to avoid heart failure and deaths. So this project uses deep learning techniques to develop a deep learning model using neural networks to predict the heart diseases. The data set is taken from Kaggle from over 4000 people with 76 attributes. Using these attributes, this project clearly depicts on how to predict heart diseases or identify them.
